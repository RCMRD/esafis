<p>The Regional Centre for Mapping of Resources for Development (RCMRD) received a Grant from Google Foundation (through the TIDES Foundation), with the support of SERVIR Africa, NASA and USAID, to procure, install, and build capacity for a MODIS direct readout antenna. The antennae is intended to provide near real time satellite data to facilitate sustainable and reliable crop and pasture monitoring, flood and fire early warning services for Eastern and Southern African Regions. The rationale for this investment is to provide state of the art technology to Eastern and Southern African Regions to advance mechanisms of early warning and improve climate change adaptation strategies. Consequently, the center, has installed the International Polar Orbiter Processing Package (IPOPP) version 2.3 to produce several products among which the MODIS Active Fire Product is one of them.</p>

<p>RCMRD has recently initiated the Eastern and Southern Africa Fire Information System (ESAFIS) that utilizes the MODIS Active Fire Product. The system is currently, capable availing the active fire through a visualization tool and email alert and SMS alert will be incorporated soon. </p>
<p>At this point, ESAFIS covers eleven countries in Eastern Africa namely Burundi, Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, Somalia, Sudan, South Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda. In the near future more countries of the region will be added.</p>

<p>Currently, ESAFIS is composed of the following features.</p>
<ul>
 <li>Displays the last 48 hour fire points (including the last captured) from the database.</li>
 <li>Shows details of each fire point with affected and nearby conservation areas, and nearby towns. This information can be obtained in marker popup and on the search fields. </li>
 <li>Provides layers for conservation areas and towns of the region. </li>
 <li>Enables users to make historical search based on time, country and conservation areas.</li>
 <li>Enables users to subscribe and receive near real-time notification for the fire occurrences in their area of interest soon after data is capture from the satellite.</li>
</ul>
