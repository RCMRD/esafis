<p><b>Map Elements</b></p>

<p>The map Elements, located as a first tab of the sidebar, is composed of the Layers list and the Legend.</p>

<p><strong>The Layers Panel</strong> is composed of Base Maps and Overlays. By default, when the system loads for the first time, the layer that will be loaded in the map is the latest captured fire point. The other layers such as the last 48 hrs fire points, conservation areas, and towns can be viewed by checking on the checkbox. More layers will be loaded when you make search using the search forms located under the Search tab. All layers that are loaded can be shown and hidden from the map and the legend panel by using the checkboxes next to each checkboxes. </p>

<p> The fire data is categorized into 4 groups based on their their brightness (Kelvin) value. </p>
<ul class="default_ul">
<li>Low Intensity Fire - Less than 310 </li>
<li>Medium Intensity Fire -  310.1 - 340.9 </li>
<li>High Intensity Fire - 341.0 - 360.9</li>
<li>Extreme Intensity Fire - Above 361.0</li>
</ul>
